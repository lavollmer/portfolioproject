# portfolioproject
Portfolio project to display an About Me, Work and Contact sections for a future employer.

## projectdescription
I created a portfolio project website for display of my website projects using HTML, and CSS. Features I am worked on include responsive design, styling, incorporating a background image and profile picture image. Additionally, I added links to navigate the page through a navigation bar, each placeholder image, and the contact me section. A feature to work on in the future includes replacing the placeholder images with my upcoming projects.

In this project, I learned about flexbox, CSS styling, incorporating links and images.
